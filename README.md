# image_classification
ML code for transfer learning

1. Using pip, install the necessary libraries imported in this project
2. Note: This project is on image classification, in which I used 4 classes (our team member face images). Change the dense function parameter (4) to the number of classes you are using (#code line: main_model = Dense(4,activation='softmax')(main_model)).
3. Save the training dataset in one folder named training, and in this folder, make individual folders for your classes and name those folders with the class name. In my case, under the training folder, I created 4 folders with the names of the group members, and within each folder with a group member,  I saved the images of that group member. These folders with the names of group members are called classes.
4. Finally, change the directories where every requirement is in the code.
