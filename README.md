# image_classification
ML code for transfer learning

1. Using pip, install the necessary libraries imported in this project
2. Note: This project is on image classification, in which I used 4 classes (our team member face images). Change the dense function parameter (4) to the number of classes you are using (#code line: main_model = Dense(4,activation='softmax')(main_model)).
3. Save the training dataset in one folder named training and in this folder make individual floders of your classes and name those folders with the class name. Inmy case under training folder I created 4 folders with the names of the group members and within each floder with group member I saved the images of that group member. These folders with the names of group members are called classes.
4. Finally change the directories where every reqired in the code.
